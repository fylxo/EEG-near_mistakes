each file has a cell array (Data_eeg) with 10 columns:
column 1 - Rat ID
column 2 - Session date
column 3 - 32 channels EEG, filtered(lowpass at 45Hz), dowsampled to 200Hz
column 4 - EEG time array aligned to 0 sec start time (only from 1 one the channels is enough)

column 6 - Velocity time array
column 7 - NM peak velocity times
column 8 - NM sizes (1,2,3)
column 9 - ITI peak velocity times
column 10 - ITI peak velocity sizes (1,2,3)
columns 8 and 10 have 1,2,3 which tell the size of the NM and the ITI-matched NM respectively
